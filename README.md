# Things that didn’t work
1.	Trying to run the project as regular Java program instead of a Maven project
2.	Trying to run the test without the Junit dependencies
3.	Trying to run a Junit test without the word test in the method. Example – addNums() instead of testAddNums()  
4.	Trying to assertNotEquals on something that does equal
